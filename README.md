# RNA-neoepitopes
This tool has been developed to detect a known list of neoepitopes in cell free RNA. It supports detection of neoepitopes from IEDB, TSNAdb, neoepitopes produced via the gene fusion events described in ChimerKB and ChimerPub (YE Jang et al. 2020: https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkz1013), and neoepitopes produced transcription of Transposable elements (NM Shah et al. 2023: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41588-023-01349-3). Cancer specific neoepitopes: TSNAdb and Transposable elements
